Jiffle
======

Jiffle is a scripting language for creating and analysing raster images. Rather than having to write 
and test lots of JAI or Java AWT boiler-plate code to access and manipulate images, Jiffle lets you 
concentrate on the interesting bit: your algorithm.

This repository is an archive of the original project. For more recent Jiffle development by the 
wonderful Andrea Aime (GeoSolutions), please see the jt-jiffle component in JAI-EXT:
